    "Dot Plots are a simple graphical approach for the visual comparison of two sequences (see Maizel and Lenk 1981 and references). They involve placing one sequence along a vertical axis of a 2D grid, a second sequence on the horizontal axis, and looking to see where the two sequences match. \n",
